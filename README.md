When completing homework assignments for school, one thing I struggled with was organization. My assignments were in different places, with different deadlines, and I needed one place to keep track of all of them. TaskPlanner does just that - its intuitive setup allows you
to create different tasks, each with their own due date and due date time. Additionally, the templates feature lets you keep track of individual steps for a task, each with a checkbox for you to cross off as you work through them. I was able to use TaskPlanner effectively to improve my own organization, and have released it in the hope that it can help others, too.
